Document description:
0: Original text from dataset
1: Just added one word "EXTRA" in the verybeginning of the original text
2: Added some characters at random in the text
3: Added extra text of roughly 60 words in the end of the document
4: Deleted the first paragraph of the original document(shortened)
5: Complete different text from dataset
6: Version of document_5 above, with some deleted lines

Computed signatures with length 1000!
The tables row and column index indicate the document IDs, the tuple in the cell has as a first entry the exact jaccard similarity from part 1 and as second entry the estimated jaccard similarity from the signatures of part2.

Running LSH...
The Rows per band and threshold are calculated from the formulas given in the book, and are as follows.
Rows per band used: 20
Threshold computed from values: 0.8223401594268891

LSH finds the following documents to be potentially similar, and the jaccard similarity confirms this.
DOC 0 and DOC 1 have similarity 0.999
DOC 0 and DOC 3 have similarity 0.801
DOC 1 and DOC 3 have similarity 0.801
DOC 5 and DOC 6 have similarity 0.808

Example Interpretation: (Keep the high threshold in mind)
DOC 0 and 1 are the same except for the first word leading to high similarity.
Doc 5 and 6 differ in a coupke lines and are therefore similar.
Notice that no document combination of (0,1,2,3,4) and (5,6) is checked by LSH. 
Each of these two sets has a different text as a base,from which changes were made. 
Therefore it makes sense that these are very different and dont get checked by LSH.
